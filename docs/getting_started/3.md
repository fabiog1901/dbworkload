# Create the workload class

We now create the Python class file that describes our workload.

This is going to be a regular `.py` file which we need to create from scratch.

Fortunately, we can use built-in function `dbworkload util gen_stub` to generate a skeleton
which we can use as a base to get started.

Read the helpful doc page for the [gen_stub](../util/gen_stub.md) command.

## Create the stub file

Execute the following command

```bash
dbworkload util gen_stub -i bank.sql
```

A new file, `bank.py`, will be created in your directory.

## Review the workload class file

The file is pretty long to be pasted here all in one shot,
so we will go through it in sections.

### Library imports

The first few lines define the imports

```python linenums="1"
import datetime as dt
import psycopg
import random
import time
from uuid import uuid4

```

These are the most common libraries used when using a workload class.
More can be added as needed.

### Class init

Here is the definition of class `Bank`.

```python linenums="8"
class Bank:
    def __init__(self, args: dict):
        # args is a dict of string passed with the --args flag
        
        self.think_time: float = float(args.get("think_time", 5) / 1000)

        # you can arbitrarely add any variables you want
        self.my_var = 1

        # translation table for efficiently generating a string
        # -------------------------------------------------------
        # make translation table from 0..255 to A..Z, 0..9, a..z
        # the length must be 256
        self.tbl = bytes.maketrans(
            bytearray(range(256)),
            bytearray(
                [ord(b"a") + b % 26 for b in range(113)]
                + [ord(b"0") + b % 10 for b in range(30)]
                + [ord(b"A") + b % 26 for b in range(113)]
            ),
        )
```

The `init` adds some convenient examples on how to pass runtime arguments and set class variables.
`self.tbl` is used to generate random string - we will review that in the next sections.

### setup()

Next up is `setup()`.
`dbworkload` invokes this function when it first starts up.

```python linenums="30"
    # the setup() function is executed only once
    # when a new executing thread is started.
    # Also, the function is a vector to receive the excuting threads's unique id and the total thread count
    def setup(self, conn: psycopg.Connection, id: int, total_thread_count: int):
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            print(
                f"My thread ID is {id}. The total count of threads is {total_thread_count}"
            )
            print(cur.execute(f"select version()").fetchone()[0])
```

### loop()

Function `loop()` is what is repeatedly executed by `dbworkload`.
In the return list you define the functions you want to execute.

```python linenums="40"
    # the loop() function returns a list of functions
    # that dbworkload will execute, sequentially.
    # Once every func has been executed, loop() is re-evaluated.
    # This process continues until dbworkload exits.
    def loop(self):
        return [
            self.txn_0,
            self.txn_1,
            self.txn_2,
            self.txn_3,
        ]
```

### Utility functions

Here the stub includes some commonly used functions, such as `random_str` to generate just that.

```python linenums="52"
    #####################
    # Utility Functions #
    #####################
    def __think__(self, conn: psycopg.Connection):
        time.sleep(self.think_time)

    def random_str(self, size: int = 12):
        return (
            random.getrandbits(8 * size)
            .to_bytes(size, "big")
            .translate(self.tbl)
            .decode()
        )
```

### Workload transactions

Next are the stub of the functions generated from the SQL statements in the `bank.sql` file.

This is the **read** operation

```python linenums="68"
    def txn_0(self, conn: psycopg.Connection):
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(
                """
                SELECT *
                FROM orders
                WHERE acc_no = %s
                  AND id = %s
                """,
                (
                    # add bind parameter,
                    # add bind parameter, 
                ), 
            ).fetchall()
```

And below are the transactions related to the **order**

```python linenums="83"

    def txn_1(self, conn: psycopg.Connection):
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(
                """
                INSERT INTO orders (acc_no, status, amount)
                VALUES (%s, 'Pending', %s) RETURNING id
                """,
                (
                    # add bind parameter,
                    # add bind parameter, 
                ), 
            ).fetchall()
    
    def txn_2(self, conn: psycopg.Connection):
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(
                """
                SELECT *
                FROM ref_data
                WHERE acc_no = %s
                """,
                (
                    # add bind parameter, 
                ), 
            ).fetchall()
    
    def txn_3(self, conn: psycopg.Connection):
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(
                """
                UPDATE orders
                SET status = 'Complete'
                WHERE (acc_no,
                       id) = (%s,
                              %s)
                """,
                (
                    # add bind parameter,
                    # add bind parameter, 
                ), 
            )
```

### Helpful tips

Finally, the stub finishes with some tips on how to generate random data

```python linenums="126"
'''
# Quick random generators reminder

# random string of 25 chars
self.random_str(25),

# random int between 0 and 100k
random.randint(0, 100000),

# random float with 2 decimals 
round(random.random()*1000000, 2)

# now()
dt.datetime.utcnow()

# random timestamptz between certain dates,
# expressed as unix ts
dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(random.randint(1655032268, 1759232268))

# random UUID
uuid4()

# random bytes
size = 12
random.getrandbits(8 * size).to_bytes(size, "big")

'''
```

In the next session, we customize the file to fit our workload.

!!! tip "Psycopg 3 basic usage"
    It might be a good idea now to refresh how the `psycopg` driver works.
    Fortunately, there is a great intro [doc](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/basic/usage.html) in the official website 🚀
